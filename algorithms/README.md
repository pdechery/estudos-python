# Time Complexity

An algorithm's time complexity specifies how long it will take to execute an algorithm *as a function of its input size*.

## Constant Time Complexity - O(1) 

Time is not dependent on the input size. Best time complexity.

## Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)

Input size decreases at each iteration, making better time complexity. Ex: binary search algorithm

## Linear Time Complexity O(n)

Time increases linearly with the size of the input. Ex: Having a single loop.

## O(n^2) - Quadratic Time Complexity

Like having nested loops.

## Exponential Time Complexity - O(2^n)

Wen the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input (n). Example: Fibonacci (ver recursion.py)
